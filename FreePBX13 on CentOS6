READ FIRST
Manual installations of FreePBX is considered an EXPERTS ONLY exercise. This method of installation is enough to get CORE functionality of FreePBX. Non-commercial modules may not function as expected or detailed in the Wiki's. Certain modules and features may require additional software to be installed and configured on the server.
**** COMMERCIAL MODULES ****
While commercial modules can be installed on CentOS 6, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THEY WILL FUNCTION AS EXPECTED OR AT ALL. If you are looking to use commercial modules it is highly recommended to use the FreePBX Distro.

For Further information see: Installation on CentOS and RHEL based systems
Initial System Setup
You MUST run all of these commands as the root user!
You MUST disable selinux.  selinux can cause strange behavior during the install
Disable selinux
In /etc/sysconfig/selinux , change the following lines:
sed -i 's/\(^SELINUX=\).*/\SELINUX=disabled/' /etc/sysconfig/selinux
reboot, and verify the selinux status by running 'sestatus'. It should say:
SELinux status: disabled
SELinux did not disable!
Generally /etc/sysconfig/selinux is linked to /etc/selinux/config but in some cases they are separate files. If the above steps do not disable selinux you will need to perform one extra step:
sed -i 's/\(^SELINUX=\).*/\SELINUX=disabled/' /etc/selinux/config
Update Your System
yum -y update
yum -y groupinstall core base "Development Tools"
Install Additional Required Dependencies
yum install gcc gcc-c++ lynx bison mysql-devel mysql-server php php-mysql php-pear php-mbstring php-xml tftp-server httpd make ncurses-devel libtermcap-devel sendmail sendmail-cf caching-nameserver sox newt-devel libxml2-devel libtiff-devel audiofile-devel gtk2-devel subversion kernel-devel git subversion kernel-devel php-process crontabs cronie cronie-anacron wget vim php-xml uuid-devel libtool sqlite-devel unixODBC mysql-connector-odbc libuuid-devel binutils-devel php-ldap
IPTables 
Keeping IPTables turned off indefinitely is strongly discouraged. You will incur the wrath of high fees and hackers
You must disable the default iptables.  You can re-enable it later, once you have made the appropriate changes.  Information on iptables can be found with a quick Google search.  If iptables is left running, it will (at very least) block you from accessing the web interface.
 
See the current status:   
chkconfig iptables --list
Disable iptables:
chkconfig --level 0123456 iptables off
Stop the service (this skips rebooting again):
service iptables stop
Auto Start MySQL
You must have mysql running for freepbx to operate normally.  You need to set it to start at boot time. with the following command:
chkconfig --level 345 mysqld on
Then start mysqld if you don't plan on rebooting during the installation phase:
service mysqld start
Auto Start Apache
You will want Apache running, so you can access the FreePBX admin interface,  You need to set it to start at boot time. with the following command:
chkconfig --level 345 httpd on
Then start apache if you don't plan on rebooting during the installation phase:
service httpd start
Install PearDB
pear channel-update pear.php.net
pear install db-1.7.14
You may receive a warning:
WARNING: "pear/DB" is deprecated in favor of "pear/MDB2"
At this time it is safe to ignore that message
Reboot server
reboot
